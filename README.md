# Ebolden
Front End Developer
The purpose of this is to build a website from scratch and showcase it. 
I have worked with Wordpress and Shopify, but would like the experience
of creating a site from the ground up. Ideally I'll use Javascript in addition to HTML and CSS.
From there I may use react and other javascript frameworks.
Will attempt to create website with multiple pages.

<h1>Sandbox<h1/>
  <button>hello world<button>
